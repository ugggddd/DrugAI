# Deep Learning in Drug Discovery

# Overview

Drug discovery and development are expensive and time-consuming processes. Developing a new drug from discovery to regulatory approval may take 12 years and cost up to $2.8 billion. Furthermore, there is a high failure rate (1:5000) at each stage of drug development [2]. With the remarkable success of machine learning in various application fields, we are seeing increasing interest in the application of machine learning in drug discovery and development [1-6]. Here, we focus on this topic and review the literature on deep learning in drug discovery.

Hosein Fooladi divides the application of deep learning in drug discovery mainly into three different categories: Drug properties prediction, De Novo drug design, and Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction [1]. The 29th IJCAI discusses key classes of methods for tackling these drug-related tasks: Generative models, Reinforcement learning, and Deep representation learning [2].
