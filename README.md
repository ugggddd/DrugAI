# Review: Deep Learning In Drug Discovery

# Overview
Drug discovery is one of the areas that can gain benefit a lot from this success of deep learning. Drug discovery is a very time-consuming and expensive task and deep learning can be used to make this process faster and cheaper. Recently, lots of papers have been published around this topic and in this post, I am going to present a detailed review to see how it is possible to use deep learning in this domain. I can divide the application of deep learning in drug discovery mainly into three different categories:

1. Drug Properites Prediction
2. Drug-Target Interaction Predcition
3. De Novo Drug Design
